The ask is one per operator, not one per browser profile. localStorage stays the fast local record —
it suppresses the prompt on this render without waiting on a request — while `githubStarPromptDismissedAt`
in global settings is the durable, cross-surface one: the CLI's post-onboarding ask reads and writes
the same field, so answering in either place retires the ask in both. The settings write is
best-effort; losing it costs at most one repeat ask on another browser, never a broken dismissal here.

FNXC:GithubStarAsk 2026-08-23-23:35:
Two different facts, deliberately kept apart. `dismissed` is the durable answer — this operator already
answered, on some surface. `resolved` says only whether the durable lookup has finished, so callers can
tell "not asked yet" from "we have not looked yet".

Collapsing them into one boolean breaks one caller or the other. Reporting "shown" while unresolved is
right for the DISPLAY gate (an unknown must never render a duplicate ask) but wrong for the TRIGGER
that records a completed task: that transition is one-shot, so a trigger suppressed during the lookup
window is dropped for good and the prompt never appears even when nobody had dismissed it. So the
display gate consumes `dismissed || !resolved`, while the trigger consumes `dismissed` alone.

Re-reads the durable answer at the moment a trigger wants to SHOW the ask, and returns whether it is
already answered. The mount-time lookup alone is not enough: first-run setup routinely has a dashboard
tab already open while the operator answers `fn onboard` in a terminal, so a stamp can land after that
lookup and this tab would otherwise ask a second time — exactly the duplicate the shared record exists
to prevent. A stamp found here is adopted locally, so the banner gate closes even if a trigger races it.
An unreachable server falls back to the local record and asks, rather than suppressing the ask forever.
