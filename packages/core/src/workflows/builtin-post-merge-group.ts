FNXC:WorkflowPostMerge 2026-06-26-09:00:
Factory for a POST-MERGE optional-group node — the graph-native execution mechanism
for post-merge workflow steps (U7 spike). Mirrors `codeReviewOptionalGroupNode` /
`browserVerificationOptionalGroupNode`, but the produced node carries
`config.phase: "post-merge"` so the graph executor:
  1. runs it only AFTER a successful merge (when wired off the merge region and the
     `graphNativePostMerge` flag is on), and
  2. records its WorkflowStepResult with `phase: "post-merge"` + emits `[post-merge]`
     logs. Advisory post-merge failures are non-blocking; explicit gate-mode
     verification failures block final graph success after merge proof.

FNXC:WorkflowPostMerge 2026-06-29-12:22:
Full task built-ins need an explicit default-off post-merge verification node so
post-merge audit/verification policy can live in workflow definitions instead of
merger-only fallback code. The group node id is the STABLE per-task enable key
(`enabledWorkflowSteps`), and the inner template node carries a DISTINCT id
(`${id}-step`) — a template node id may not collide with the group/top-level node id
(optional-group validation).

export const POST_MERGE_VERIFICATION_GROUP_ID = "post-merge-verification";

const POST_MERGE_VERIFICATION_PROMPT = `You are a post-merge verification reviewer. Verify that the task's merged result is safe after integration.

## Review focus
1. Confirm the task has merge proof or already-on-main proof before treating the workflow as complete.
2. Check the final merged diff and task summary for obvious mismatches, missing verification evidence, or integration-only regressions.
3. If configured test/build commands are available in the task context, inspect their latest result or explain why no post-merge command was applicable.

## Output Requirements
- APPROVE: post-merge verification is acceptable.
- APPROVE_WITH_NOTES: completion may proceed with non-blocking notes.
- REVISE: completion should be blocked; include the concrete post-merge issue and the needed follow-up.
- \`notes\` MUST contain one to three non-empty sentences naming what was checked and why the verdict was reached. An empty \`notes\` string is a protocol violation.
- Final output: output exactly one trailing JSON object on the final line (no markdown fences, no surrounding prose):
{"verdict":"APPROVE|APPROVE_WITH_NOTES|REVISE","notes":"..."}`;
