/**
 * FNXC:Lifecycle 2026-06-14-19:54:
 * FN-6461/FN-6455 showed that release and ops tasks marked `noCommitsExpected` can be silently finalized as no-op after skipping substantive steps.
 * Zero-diff finalize lanes must only trust step evidence when completed work outweighs incomplete work; ties block because a todo requeue is recoverable while dropping operational work is not.
 *
 * FNXC:Lifecycle 2026-07-16-14:20:
 * FN-8141 laundered a REVERTED (commit-expected) task to `done`: pi SDK bumps kept breaking verify, the work was reverted 5x, and the agent marked "Testing & Verification" + "Documentation & Delivery" skipped. The branch was empty vs main, so the AI empty-merge lane finalized it as a no-op with `mergeConfirmed:true` and no reviewer ever saw it.
 * The FN-6461 rule missed it twice: it only fired for `noCommitsExpected === true` (FN-8141 was commit-expected), and even then only when incomplete >= done (FN-8141 had 3 done vs 2 skipped).
 * New invariant: a zero-diff/no-op finalize is blocked whenever ANY step is `skipped` (empty diff + skipped step means work was never done or was reverted, so `done` is unsafe). A verification-flavored skipped step (name matching /test|verif|qa|review/i) blocks unconditionally; any other skipped step blocks unless every non-skipped step is `done` AND the task is the legacy `noCommitsExpected` ops shape. This is evaluated only at zero-diff finalize lanes, so the empty-diff condition is supplied by the caller.
