FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-05:40 (E2E evidence — the optional-role-parameter class, measured):

#2795 found one instance of a conversion pattern the lifecycle-column census cannot see: a role
question migrated into an OPTIONAL parameter whose default is the legacy literal, converted at some
call sites and not others. This file shows it is not a one-off, and measures it.

THE PATTERN. The callee is converted and its default is correctly marked DELIBERATE-LITERAL, because
for an unconverted caller that default IS the intended behaviour. The unconverted CALL SITES contain
no column literal at all — the literal lives one function away. So the census counts the callee's
literals (correctly annotated) and sees nothing at the call sites, and the conversion reads as
complete from every angle except running it.

TWO MEASURED SEAMS:

  shouldHoldActiveFileScopeLease   4 of 4 call sites pass the resolved answer   (#2795, closed by #2975)
  evaluateParkedAgentTaskLink      2 of 6 call sites pass the resolved answer   (this file)

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-23:30 (first seam CLOSED; number updated deliberately):
The lease seam was 2-of-4 when measured. #2975 converted both self-healing sites, this counter failed
on the advance that landed it, and the number below moved on purpose — which is the whole reason the
audit asserts an exact count instead of a floor. The parked-link seam is UNCHANGED at 2-of-6, so the
class this file exists to measure is not closed; one of its two instances is.

The second is the more damaging. Its own FNXC note states the consequence exactly: without the
resolved columns "the card would be treated as unparked and its live agent link cleared" — a
stale-link bug turned into a DROPPED-link bug. The four unconverted callers are the two in
`agent-heartbeat.ts` and the two in `self-healing.ts`; the converted two are in `scheduler.ts` and
`task-agent-sync.ts` itself.

SCOPE, STATED HONESTLY. The behavioural differential is driven end to end: real persisted rows from a
live PostgreSQL store, the real exported predicate, both call shapes. The CALL-SITE SPLIT is asserted
against source text, not driven through the heartbeat and self-healing sweeps — reaching all six
sites needs harnesses I did not build. The audit case says so in its own comment. Its job is to be an
alarm and a counter: it fails when a new unconverted caller appears AND when someone converts an
existing one, so the number cannot drift silently in either direction.

LANE. `.pg.test.ts`, skipped via `pgDescribe` when no PostgreSQL is reachable, so the merge gate is
unaffected. Throwaway per-file database; never port 4040.

    An alarm in BOTH directions. A new unconverted caller pushes the count up and fails; converting
    an existing one pushes it down and also fails, which is deliberate — that is the moment someone
    should read the three cases above and update this number on purpose.

    FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-22:55 (the alarm fired DOWNWARD — re-recorded 2 -> 4, and
    the count is now split by RESOLUTION PATH, which is the part that nearly got laundered):

    Two more sites started passing `parkedColumns`, so the shape count rose to 4. Re-recording it at 4
    and stopping would have been wrong. Walking all six before touching the number:

        agent-heartbeat.ts:1267   no parkedColumns                                 UNCONVERTED
        agent-heartbeat.ts:3796   no parkedColumns                                 UNCONVERTED
        self-healing.ts:13184     await resolveProjectColumnsForRoles  (:13170)     async-resolved

        scheduler.ts:1761         await resolveTaskParkedColumns       (:1760)      async-resolved

    All four now resolve through an awaited resolver that reads the task's real selection. FN-8656
    ("resolve scheduler lanes for renamed holds") repointed the last site, `scheduler.ts`'s
    `rollbackParked`, from the inert `resolveTaskParkedColumnsSync` (which reached
    `getTaskWorkflowSelectionImpl` — `undefined` under PostgreSQL — and returned the DEFAULT builtin
    IR, answering `hold`/`intake` as `todo`/`triage` on every board exactly as the literal did) at the
    awaited `resolveTaskParkedColumns`. The seam is closed at 4-of-4 async, 0 sync.

    A SECOND kind of inertness sits at `self-healing.ts:13184` and is deliberately NOT asserted below:
    that sweep's gate is `hasFreshRun || hasActiveExecution`, which never reads
    `shouldPreserveParkedLink`, so its correctly-resolved set decides nothing today. Its own FNXC note
    says so and explains why it is kept anyway. Recorded here as prose because resolution path is
    mechanically checkable and "the gate never reads the answer" is not — asserting the second on a
    string match would produce a number nobody could maintain.

    So a bare `parkedConverted.length === 4` would have recorded this seam as two-thirds converted
    while a quarter of that progress cannot change behaviour on any board. That is the inert
    conversion class — and it would have been recorded by the very audit written to catch it, which is
    why the split below asserts the RESOLUTION PATH and not just the presence of the key.

    The scheduler site is asserted BY NAME below so it cannot quietly regress to a sync resolution.
    FN-8656 converted it, so its entry moved from the inert list to the live one.
