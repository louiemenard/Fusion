FNXC:WorkflowAgentRouting 2026-08-23-22:22:
Regression coverage for the workflow-principal hold cooldown, which the U4 executor peel (#3317) left
recorded, cleared, and never honored: the reader was dropped from executeCore and re-inlined inside
executeWorkflowGraph behind `!opts?.alreadyClaimed`, a flag its only caller always sets.

The invariant under test is "a recorded hold defers dispatch", asserted across every surface that can enter
the graph — the claimed outer routing path (executeCore) and direct unclaimed graph entry — plus the negative
cases that keep the guard from becoming a permanent block. Asserting only the reported symptom would let the
same reader go missing from the other surface, which is exactly how it was lost.
