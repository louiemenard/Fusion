  "in-review". builtin:coding places its merge-class nodes (merge-gate /
  merge-attempt / …) in `in-review`, so the default pipeline lands in `in-review`
  exactly as before (KTD-7 parity oracle). A user-authored workflow (the 6-column
  benchmark) places the merge node in `Merging`, so the card lands there because
  the IR says so — deleting the hardcoded-"in-review" +
  handoff-invariant-violation-allowlist assumption. Resolution failures fall back

  User-authored workflows may legitimately route execution directly to a merge node without an explicit review node. Reaching that node is the workflow-owned merge boundary, so the engine must establish the durable in-review/merge lifecycle handoff before requesting merge instead of assuming a prior node already moved the card.

  Compound Engineering and similar graph-native workflows execute skill nodes instead of legacy parsed task steps. The graph records those nodes as `workflowStepResults.source = "node"`; at the merge boundary, project a successful graph-native run onto the legacy checklist so `task has incomplete steps` cannot block a workflow that already completed its authoritative nodes.

  A TASK THAT LEGITIMATELY PRODUCED NOTHING HAS NOTHING TO PROVE.

  This proof asks "did the planned implementation actually run" and refuses the boundary when a
  foreach step-execute region left no terminal node result. That is right for work that was supposed
  to happen. It is meaningless for a task whose accepted outcome is that no work happens at all — a
  verified duplicate or an authorized no-commit decision — because there is no implementation whose
  absence could be suspicious.

  Measured on a live card: MULT-024 was closed through the duplicate sentinel ("explicitly duplicates
  MULT-010; implementation should not proceed", recorded as no commits expected). Its Code Review had
  nothing to read and finished in 265ms without recording a result, so the boundary found no node
  result and terminalized the card with `merge-boundary-unproven — operator action required`. A task
  that did exactly what was asked ended as an error demanding human rescue.

  The exemption is deliberately narrow: `noCommitsExpected` is set by an authorized terminal decision,
  and every step must already be settled, so a card with pending work still faces the full proof. It
  waives only THIS structural proof — pre-merge approval, blocking statuses and the no-op finalize
  guard (which still refuses a SKIPPED verification step over an empty diff, FN-8141) all continue to
  apply at the merge door itself.
