/**
 * FNXC:ReviewGatedVerification 2026-08-25-08:15:
 * Review-gated Verification is a measurement, never an agent claim: the verdict comes only from
 * command exit codes.
 *
 * It DELEGATES to `runExecutorDeterministicVerification`, the same primitive the in-progress
 * executor gate (FN-3345, run-implementation.ts) has always used. The previous revision re-derived
 * the command list and re-ran the loop itself — a second implementation of one rule, which is how
 * the two drifted: this copy treated "no command configured" as a hard failure while the executor
 * path treats it as not-applicable. Reusing the primitive means the timeout handling, per-command
 * logging, and settings precedence can only be fixed in one place.
 *
 * FNXC:WorkflowStepNotRun 2026-08-28-14:13:
 * FN-226 closes the false-green gap for an unconfigured gate. The success edge still advances the
 * graph, while the context patch records `not-configured`; graph recorders persist it as `skipped`
 * plus `notRunReason`. Pre-merge approval admits only non-code, non-plan not-run gates, preserving
 * the non-blocking default without presenting missing verification as a pass.
